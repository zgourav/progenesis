      <p>
        IMSI is a refinement of ICSI that uses high-power magnification to examine
        sperm morphology in great detail. This technique increases the chances
        of selecting the most viable sperm for injection.
      </p>
      <p>
        At our center, IMSI has shown better outcomes in severe male infertility cases.
